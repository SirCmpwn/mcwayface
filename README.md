This is a demonstration Wayland compositor that accompanies a series of blog
posts written for [drewdevault.com](https://drewdevault.com).

## Compiling

```shell
mkdir build
cd build
meson ..
ninja
```

This will produce a binary named `mcwayface`, this is your compositor. Run it
without any arguments.
